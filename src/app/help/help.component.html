<h3 class="text-center">Welcome to WikiRate-Dashboard</h3>
<br>
<div class="row m-1 text-justify">
<p>WikiRate - Dashboard provides an overview of the data stored and presented into the <a href="https://wikirate.org/">WikiRate</a> platform mostly focused on the <a href="https://wikirate.org/About_Metrics">Researched Metrics</a>.</p>

<p>Company Overview provides an overview of the selected company in terms of its transparency performance in a sense (answers per Topic) and also some visualizations regarding some selected by our admins researched metrics. We are planning on extending Company Overview to allow users select research metrics they want to visualize.</p>

<p>Compare: It is a tool (in a previous version it was called DynaMat) and leverages WikiRate's open data to generate dynamically comparison matrices based on users' preferences. We are also planning on extending to provide Custom Summaries (comparison metrices) based on existing projects on WikiRate platform.</p>
